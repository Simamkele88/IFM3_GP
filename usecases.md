## Problem Statement

### Problems 
- There is lack of real-time inventory tracking. Where stock can be tracked in a faster way.
- Data entry in Excel spreadsheets and paper records increases the risk of errors, such as incorrect stock counts or misplaced invoices
- Inefficient order management.
- Difficulty managing spare parts.
- increased operational costs
- There is no analysis and reports about the stock. 

## Proposed Solutions

##  Smart Inventory Management System:

- To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Smart Inventory Management System for MTM Distributors. This is a software tool that helps businesses to keep track of their stock by providing real-time updates on stock levels. Invoices will be generated automatically within the system. Spare parts will be tracked digitally, making it easy to search for and update information. This system helps to manage sales and purchase orders and can suggest when to reorder . The system will automatically generate reports based on stock levels.

- This system will make use of a mobile app used by the staff on-the-go to do stock updates , receiving notifications and also for task management.
