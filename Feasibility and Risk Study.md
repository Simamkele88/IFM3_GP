## Feasibility and Risk Study 

### a. System feasibility
Our management system incorporates an internal barcode reader to enhance product tracking in warehouses, a feature commonly found in existing Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). It also includes task delegation from admins to workers, a standard in modern management platforms.

By leveraging proven technologies, we minimize development risks and ensure efficiency. However, we will customize these technologies to meet our specific operational needs, ensuring the system is tailored to our requirements.

### b. Technical feasibility 
The hardware, such as barcode scanners, is widely used in warehouse management, making it a reliable choice. For software, we will use a barcode scanner API, 3D warehouse modeling, and other established frameworks, all of which are well-documented and easy to implement.

Challenges include integrating the barcode scanner and 3D modeling tools seamlessly, as well as ensuring scalability as the system grows.

### c. Economic feasibility
The total cost of ownership is low, with minimal expenses like one barcode scanner per small warehouse and affordable software subscriptions. The system offers strong ROI due to its scalability—operational costs rise linearly, while profit potential grows exponentially.

The project aligns with the sponsor’s budget, utilizing cost-effective equipment and avoiding unnecessary APIs. The main risk lies in potential implementation delays or unforeseen challenges.

### d. Operational feasibility
The system’s intuitive interface caters to different user roles, making training quick and straightforward. It integrates smoothly with existing workflows, ensuring a transition period of just a few days.

While the system is user-friendly, some advanced features may require skilled professionals to operate. Key risks include real-time tracking across multiple warehouses, which could be prone to human error at scale, and products without barcodes, which may complicate data storage.

This study outlines the system’s strengths while addressing potential challenges, ensuring a balanced and realistic implementation plan.
