## Feasibility and Risk Study 

### a. System feasibility
Our management system has an internal barcode reader which helps to speed up the process of tracking products in the warehouse, which functions similar to some of the existing WMS websites. Our system will also include delegation of tasks from admin to workers which is quite a standard in most web3 management websites.

Since well most technologies we will be using are already existing and proven technologies. It will be easy for us to reuse and leverage those technologies in our system and minimize risks.
Although we will be reusing most of the existing technologies, it is important that we customize everything to meet our specific needs or requirements.

### b. Technical feasibility 


### c. Economic feasibility


### d. Operational feasibility
