# 1. Background, Problem Statement & Proposed Solution 

## a. Introduction
We are Team Phantom Syndicates, a group of third-year Computer Science and Software Engineering students from the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering. Our team members:

 ### Project Goal:
*  Develop a Smart Inventory Management System for MTM Distributors to streamline operations and improve efficiency.


## b. Company / Industry background
MTM Distributors, founded by Tahir Mahmood in 2016, operates as a small distribution center within Supreme Industrial Park, Steeledale. The company specializes in distributing electronic products to smaller shops and businesses. Over the years, MTM Distributors has built a reputation for reliability and quality service. However, as the business grows, the limitations of its current manual inventory management processes are becoming wide.
## c. Current system(s) or/and procedures followed
Currently, MTM Distributors uses a combination of paper records and Excel spreadsheets to manage its inventory, orders, and spare parts. The following are the key processes in place:

### 1.Stock Receiving:

* When an order arrives, the invoice (containing details such as invoice number, supplier name, company name, model number, quantity, and price) is manually recorded in an Excel sheet.

* Staff must physically check the warehouse to verify stock levels, as there is no real-time tracking system.

### 2.Stock Sales:

* When items are sold, an invoice is manually created using Microsoft Publisher.

* The sold items are marked in the same Excel sheet used for stock receiving.

### 3.Spare Parts Management:

* Spare parts are recorded and tracked in a physical book, making it difficult to search for or update information.

These processes are inefficient, prone to human error, and lack real-time visibility into stock levels, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and operational inefficiencies.

## d. Problem Statement: Concise description of the issue(s) to be addressed
MTM Distributors faces several challenges due to its reliance on manual inventory management processes:

Staff must physically check the warehouse to determine stock levels, leading to delays and inefficiencies. 
Manual data entry in Excel spreadsheets and paper records increases the risk of errors, such as incorrect stock counts or misplaced invoices.
The creation of invoices using Microsoft Publisher is time-consuming and lacks integration with inventory data.
Spare parts are tracked in a physical book, making it difficult to search for or update information.

These issues result in wasted time, increased operational costs, and a reduced ability to meet customer demands effectively.
## e. Proposed Solution: Should apply a desired result to the problem and describe the benefits
To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Smart Inventory Management System for MTM Distributors. This is a software tool that helps businesses to keep track of their stock. It shows you what’s in stock in real time, helps manage sales and purchases, can suggest when to reorder items. This system enables stock management (track stock levels across levels e.g. warehouse , shelves , categorize items ), Order management (Process customer orders , update the stock levels as items are sold). This system will make use of a mobile app used by the staff on-the-go to do stock updates , receiving notifications and also for task management.
 .This system will automate and streamline inventory management processes, providing real-time visibility into stock levels and improving overall efficiency.

### Key Features of the Proposed Solution:

###   1.Real-Time Inventory Tracking:

* The system will provide real-time updates on stock levels, eliminating the need for checking physically.

###	2.Barcode Scanning:

* Staff can use barcode scanners to quickly and accurately record incoming and outgoing stock.

###	3.Automated Purchase Orders:

* The system will automatically generate purchase orders when stock levels fall below predefined reorder points.

###	4.Integrated Invoice Management:

* Invoices will be generated automatically within the system, reducing manual effort and errors.

###	5.Spare Parts Management:

* Spare parts will be tracked digitally, making it easy to search for and update information.

###	6.Reporting and Analytics:

* The system will generate reports on stock levels, sales, and order history, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

### Benefits of the Proposed Solution:

1. Automation of manual processes will save time and reduce errors.
2. Staff will have instant access to accurate stock levels, improving decision-making.
3. The system will support MTM Distributors’ growth by handling increased inventory and order volumes.
4. Reduced errors and improved efficiency will lower operational costs.
5. Faster order processing and accurate inventory data will improve customer service.
