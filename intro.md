## 1. Background, Problem Statement & Proposed Solution 

### a. Introduction
The supply chain must meet the demands of consumers
Inventory management is crucial for any business to operate efficiently by tracking stock and fulfilling orders. Numerous distributors struggle with tracking stock and rely on outdated pen-and-paper methods, which are time-consuming and inefficient.

### b. Company / Industry background
Started by Tahir Mahmood in 2016, MTM Distributors is a warehouse that functions as a small distribution center. It is amongst many warehouses within Supreme Industrial Park, Steeledale. As its name suggests, the warehouse focuses on distributing various electronic products to other smaller shops and businesses alike.

### c. Current system(s) or/and procedures followed
The warehouse has been tracking stock, orders, and spare parts using paper and Excel spreadsheets. Since there is no current centralized system in place to track stock levels in real-time, there are some processes involved. When an order arrives, the invoice (which has info such as invoice number, supplier name, company name, model number, quantity, price, etc) is manually recorded in an Excel sheet. Since there is no system to actively check inventory; admin or staff will physically need to go to where the item is placed within the warehouse. 

When selling items, an invoice is generated for the customer. The invoice is created manually through Microsoft Publisher with details of the company and customer. When it comes to ordering spares, they are recorded and tracked in a book. Items that are sold are marked in the same Excel sheet used when stock is received. That same Excel sheet has been used for many years, and backups have been made of it in case of loss.

### d. Problem Statement: Concise description of the issue(s) to be addressed
MTM Distributors find difficulty in managing stock due to manual tracking methods. 

### e. Proposed Solution: Should apply a desired result to the problem and describe the benefits
The solution is an inventory management system that can assist small distributors in managing stock, orders, and product returns efficiently. The system includes:
-An app where staff can scan barcodes of items.
-Web dashboard where admin can view reports and monitor inventory. 

The benefits include:
-Better stock and item return tracking.
-Reduced stock misplacing and improved order fulfillment.
