## 1. Background, Problem Statement & Proposed Solution 

### a. Introduction
In today’s fast-paced business environment, efficient inventory management is critical for the success of any distribution company. Distribution centers help meet the demand of consumers by ensuring efficient delivery of goods.  
They bridge the gap between manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers. For this to happen, the day-to-day operations of distributors must be streamlined.
MTM Distributors, a small but growing warehouse in Supreme Industrial Park, Steeledalecurrently relies on manual processes and outdated tools like Excel spreadsheets to manage its inventory. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks real-time visibility into stock levels. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Smart Inventory Management System that will streamline MTM Distributors’ operations, improve accuracy, and provide real-time insights into inventory levels. 


### b. Company / Industry background
MTM Distributors, founded by Tahir Mahmood in 2016, operates as a small distribution center within Supreme Industrial Park, Steeledale. The company specializes in distributing electronic products to smaller shops and businesses. Over the years, MTM Distributors has built a reputation for reliability and quality service. However, as the business grows, the limitations of its current manual inventory management processes are becoming wide.

The distribution industry is highly competitive, and companies must ensure efficient operations to remain profitable. Real-time inventory tracking, accurate order management, and streamlined processes are essential for meeting customer demands and maintaining a competitive edge. Unfortunately, MTM Distributors’ reliance on paper-based records and Excel spreadsheets is hindering its ability to scale and operate efficiently.
### c. Current system(s) or/and procedures followed
Currently, MTM Distributors uses a combination of paper records and Excel spreadsheets to manage its inventory, orders, and spare parts. The following are the key processes in place:

# 1.Stock Receiving:

* When an order arrives, the invoice (containing details such as invoice number, supplier name, company name, model number, quantity, and price) is manually recorded in an Excel sheet.

* Staff must physically check the warehouse to verify stock levels, as there is no real-time tracking system.

# 2.Stock Sales:

* When items are sold, an invoice is manually created using Microsoft Publisher.

* The sold items are marked in the same Excel sheet used for stock receiving.

# 3.Spare Parts Management:

* Spare parts are recorded and tracked in a physical book, making it difficult to search for or update information.

# 4.Backups:

* The Excel sheet used for inventory management has been in use for many years, with backups made manually to prevent data loss.

These manual processes are inefficient, prone to human error, and lack real-time visibility into stock levels, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and operational inefficiencies.

### d. Problem Statement: Concise description of the issue(s) to be addressed
MTM Distributors faces several challenges due to its reliance on manual inventory management processes:

Staff must physically check the warehouse to determine stock levels, leading to delays and inefficiencies. 
Manual data entry in Excel spreadsheets and paper records increases the risk of errors, such as incorrect stock counts or misplaced invoices.
The manual creation of invoices using Microsoft Publisher is time-consuming and lacks integration with inventory data.
Spare parts are tracked in a physical book, making it difficult to search for or update information.

These issues result in wasted time, increased operational costs, and a reduced ability to meet customer demands effectively.
