# Feasibility and Risk Study

##  System feasibility
- The proposed Inventory Management System shares similarities with existing inventory solutions used by wholesalers and distributors. These systems typically include stock tracking, order management, and supplier coordination. However, our system offers customized functionalities tailored for a small distributor business, such as:

    - Supplier Communication: Unlike many generic inventory systems, this system allows direct interaction with suppliers for faulty product returns.
    - Independent Mobile & Web Application: Most inventory systems are web-based only, but our solution includes a mobile app for employees to update stock conditions in real-time.
    - Notification Management: Automated alerts for low stock, pending purchase orders, and faulty product tracking.
    - Warehouse Space Tracking: A feature that helps the admin check available storage space in different warehouses.
  
##  Technical feasibility
### Hardware Requirements

    Server: A cloud-based or on-premises server for hosting the backend.
    Admin's Device: A PC/laptop with internet access.
    Employeeâ€™s Device: Mobile phones (Android/iOS) to access the mobile app.
    Barcode Scanner (Optional): If automated stock scanning is needed.

### Software Requirements

    Backend:Javascript and .NET Core with MySQL for database management.
    Frontend:
        Web Application: HTML, CSS, 
        Mobile Application: Built in Android studio
    Version Control: GitHub for source code management.

## Economic feasibility
- This system may be very less expensive since it's not for big companies.
- 
## Operational feasibility
The system is user-friendly and practical for both admins and employees.
